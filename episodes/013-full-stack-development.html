                    What does it mean to be a full-stack developer as opposed to front- or back-end?
                    Is anyone really full-stack?
                    Is it a reflection of who you are, or is it more about how your company chooses to operate?
                    Whether or not you have a preference for the part of the stack you work in,
                    there is value to expanding your understanding and collaboration.
                </p>

                    Host introductions.
                    What is "full-stack?"
                    Working across databases, server-side code, and client-side code.

                    People tend to have a preference toward either front- or back-end.
                    The types of problems are different;
                    e.g. single-user SPA vs. stateless, multi-tenant API.

                    [00:10:52]
                    Whether you go full-stack is partly an organizational design question.
                    Companies change over time and there are successful ones on both ends of the spectrum.
                    What do you value?
                </p>
                <p>
                    [00:16:50]
                    Full-stack is about working together as a team, similar to DevOps.
                    Whether you have full-stack developers should depend on your context.
                    If you only know one part of the stack, you don't know how your problem affects the other parts of the stack.
                </p>

                    [00:20:19]
                    Should full-stack teams include non-tech roles?
                    Small teams feel effective because of the natural collaboration.
                    How much of each specialty can you put on a team?
                </p>
                <p>
                    [00:25:57]
                    Does Agile scale?
                    What kinds of architectures support independent, self-replicating teams?
                    Company organization reveals how to behave within that company.

                    What are you trying to accomplish?
                    Where do you need to fall on the spectrum of being too generic vs. too specific?
                </p>
                <p>
                    [00:36:23]
                    Try out different parts of the stack to gain experience and learn what you like.
                    Get familiar with the specialties that you regularly integrate with &mdash; including non-tech roles.
                </p>

                    [00:41:49]
                    The definition of full-stack should also include soft skills.
                    Developers should understand the go-to-market strategy.
