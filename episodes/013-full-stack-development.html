                    What does it mean to be a full-stack developer as opposed to front- or back-end?
                    Is anyone really full-stack?
                    Is it a reflection of who you are, or is it more about how your company chooses to operate?
                    Whether or not you have a preference for the part of the stack you work in,
                    there is value to expanding your understanding and collaboration.
                </p>

                    Host introductions.
                    What is "full-stack?"
                    Working across databases, server-side code, and client-side code.
                </p>

                    People tend to have a preference toward either front- or back-end.
                    The types of problems are different;
                    e.g. single-user SPA vs. stateless, multi-tenant API.
                </p>
                <p>
                    [00:10:52]
                    Whether you go full-stack is partly an organizational design question.
                    Companies change over time and there are successful ones on both ends of the spectrum.
                    What do you value?
                </p>
                <p>
                    [00:16:50]
                    Full-stack is about working together as a team, similar to DevOps.
                    Whether you have full-stack developers should depend on your context.
                    If you only know one part of the stack, you don't know how your problem affects the other parts of the stack.
                </p>

                    [00:20:19]
                    Should full-stack teams include non-tech roles?
                    Small teams feel effective because of the natural collaboration.
                    How much of each specialty can you put on a team?
                </p>
                <p>
                    [00:25:57]
                    Does Agile scale?
                    What kinds of architectures support independent, self-replicating teams?
                    Company organization reveals how to behave within that company.
                </p>

                    What are you trying to accomplish?
                    Where do you need to fall on the spectrum of being too generic vs. too specific?
                </p>
                <p>
                    [00:36:23]
                    Try out different parts of the stack to gain experience and learn what you like.
                    Get familiar with the specialties that you regularly integrate with &mdash; including non-tech roles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    [00:41:49]
                    The definition of full-stack should also include soft skills.
                    Developers should understand the go-to-market strategy.
