                    Coding is a specialized skill where we learn to communicate with a machine.
                    Unfortunately, this can often blind us to the fact that crafting code involves a lot of communication with humans.
                    Writing clean, expressive code communicates with other coders.
                    Communicating well with non-coders helps us understand business needs so we can write the right code.

                    Host introductions.
                    Writing code for humans.
                </p>
                <p>
                    [00:08:08]
                    Why is naming things so hard?
                    Don't tell lies in the code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    [00:13:32]
                    Clean code in practical terms.
                    Communicating intent.
                    Understanding why code was written that way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    [00:17:45]
                    Skiing metaphor: are there black diamond codebases?
                    Don't be the abominable snowman.
                </p>
                <p>
                    [00:24:49]
                    How do we effectively communicate between "engineering" and "the business?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    [00:30:20]
                    Using concepts from Domain Driven Design: ubiquitous language and the bounded context.
                </p>
                <p>
                    [00:39:30]
                    Being on the same page with your terminology can help you go fast.
                    Learn how to articulate the concepts of code so you can "do the thing."
                </p>
                <p>
                    [00:45:51]
                    Saying yes, no, and giving estimates.
                    What did the other person think you just agreed to?
                </p>
                <p>
                    [00:51:52]
                    A whiteboard is a great tool for communicating an architectural vision.
                    Hands-on exercises reinforce fast feedback.
                </p>
                <p>
                    [00:59:04]
                    Focus on what brings customer value; they don't care about the technology you used to build it.
                    Don't let the technique or tech eclipse the business value.
                </p>
