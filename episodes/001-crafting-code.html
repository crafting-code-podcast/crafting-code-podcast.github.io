                    What does it mean to craft software?
                    In this first episode, your hosts David Adsit, Matt Baker, and Allan Stewart discuss what we think software craftsmanship is all about.
                    We cover how crafting code helps you find better ways of doing things, steadily add value, and build a community of professionals.
                    We also talk about how this craft is not about art as an expression or perfectionism; nor is it about elitism or exclusion.

                    Host introductions.
                    What does it mean to craft software?
                    Learning from problems to find better ways of doing things.
                </p>
                <p>
                    [00:08:29]
                    Formal definition.

                    Getting it working is just the beginning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    [00:13:05]
                    Steadily adding value.
                    Value depends on the context.
                </p>
                <p>
                    [00:19:40]
                    Finding a community of mutual assistance and sharing ideas.
                    Kindred spirits experiencing the same kinds of problems.
                    More than doing the right thing, doing it the best way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    [00:26:35]
                    Going through phases as we progress.
                    Experience as a reason for doing things a certain way.
                    Understanding how we got to an answer.
                </p>

                    [00:33:52]
                    What is not crafting code?
                    Software art as expression is awesome, but isn't craftsmanship.
                </p>
                <p>
                    [00:38:15]
                    Crafting code is not perfectionism or gold plating.
                </p>
                <p>
                    [00:43:43]
                    It is not about elitism, but doing your best work.
                    We run the risk of being elitist when we say one idea is better than another.
                </p>
