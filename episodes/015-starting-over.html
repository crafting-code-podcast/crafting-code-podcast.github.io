                    Starting a new job can be a nerve-wracking experience.
                    There's a lot to learn if you are going to be effective in your new position.
                    Sometimes change is forced upon you, but there are reasons to voluntarily start over.
                    It can be an important part of our personal or career journey.

                    Host introductions.
                    When starting a new job, seek to gain context.
                    Give people the benefit of the doubt.

                    Balance learning against your own experience - don't capsize the boat with too many changes all at once.
                    Suppress your own ideas early on.
                    Understanding is critical to applying patterns and <i>Fearless Change</i>.

                    Why start over?
                    Layoffs or getting fired. Career progress or a raise.
                    Opportunity to learn and grow.
                    People leave their boss.

                    Burnout.
                    Your mental state impacts your physical state.
                    Burnout can be similar to a state of depression.

                    Psychologically, perceived direction can be more important than the current position.
                    It can be really exciting to be part of a big positive change.
                </p>

                    [00:24:54]
                    Developers tend to be more loyal to their company than the company is to them (or even deserves).
                    ABQ = "always be quitting."
                    Early in your career you should get experience to be exposed to many things.

                    [00:28:31]
                    We need journeys of self discovery, much like in the Black Cauldron series.
                    Learning and growth are painful.
                    Hawthorn effect: environmental changes (might?) have a big effect.

                    [00:32:11]
                    Lack of influence or impact can be a reason to start over.
                    It is easier to have impact in a smaller business.
                    Success usually leads to growth and therefore less impact.
