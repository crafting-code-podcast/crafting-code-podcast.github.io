                <p>The concept and principles of crafting software have made a dramatic difference for the hosts of this podcast.
                Applying these ideas has helped us to write better code, build maintainable systems, and be more professional.
                We've also seen the improvement they have on development teams.</p>

                <p>
                    In this podcast, your hosts discuss the importance of doing the right thing, at the right time, with the right tools.
                    To us, this is one of the keys to <a href="http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/">software craftsmanship</a>.
                    We talk about experiences we've had and share advice on improving software development outcomes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We strongly advocate being part of a community of professionals. You can find us at our local group, the
                    <a href="http://utahsc.org/">Utah Software Craftsmanship</a> meetup. There are also other groups worldwide;
                    discover them (or add your own) at <a href="https://softwarecrafters.org/">softwarecrafters.org</a>.
